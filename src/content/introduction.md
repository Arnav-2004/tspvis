# Traveling Salesman Problem

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where a salesperson must visit a set of cities, exactly once, and return to the starting city, finding the shortest possible route. It's a computationally challenging problem, especially as the number of cities increases, making finding the absolute shortest path difficult.

### Problem Definition

- Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the TSP asks for the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
- The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled.

### Complexity:

- The TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning that finding the optimal solution becomes computationally very expensive as the number of cities grows.
- For example, with 'n' cities, there can be (n-1)! possible routes to consider, making exhaustive search impractical for larger instances.

### Applications:

- TSP has applications in various fields, including:
  - Logistics and delivery: Optimizing delivery routes for efficiency and cost reduction.
  - Circuit board manufacturing: Determining the shortest path for a drill to create connections.
  - Robotics and automation: Planning the most efficient paths for robots to perform tasks.
  - Astronomy: Studying the optimal paths for astronomical observations.
  - Computer science: Analyzing algorithms and complexity.
